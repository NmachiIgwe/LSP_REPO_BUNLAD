Nmachi: I’m working on a CRC design for an Air Traffic Control system.
 Each aircraft sends its data to the ground station — how do I identify the right classes for this?

AI: Start by modeling real-world entities as classes. 
You’ll likely need an Aircraft class (for flight data), an ATCStation class (for managing incoming data), and possibly a DisplaySystem class.
Focus on responsibilities: receiving, unpacking, storing, and displaying information.

Nmachi: Should the Aircraft class handle packet decoding or is that the ATCStation’s job?
AI: Good question — decoding is typically the ground station’s responsibility.
Keep the Aircraft class simple (only holds data like ID, type, position), and let the ATCStation or a helper class (PacketDecoder) handle unpacking. 
This separation keeps the CRC cleaner.

Juju: I have attributes and responsibilities for each class, but it feels redundant. Is that normal?
AI: Some overlap is fine, but avoid duplication. If two classes share the same data or methods, see if one can use the other through association or aggregation. 
CRC diagrams should emphasize collaboration, not repetition.
