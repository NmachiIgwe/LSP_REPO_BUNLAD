The UML shows Car with three subclasses Base, Sports, and Luxury. That design models trim by inheritance: the class of an object encodes its trim. In Java, an object’s runtime class is fixed once constructed; you cannot change an object’s class in-place. A built Base instance cannot become a Luxury instance without creating a new object of the Luxury class and copying or migrating state (VIN, options, production stage, sensors, etc.). That has several problems:

• Loss of object identity: Replacing the instance breaks identity semantics (references to the original instance, object equality, identity in in-memory caches, listeners, or task queues). Unless you perform careful state transfer, you risk losing event subscriptions or temporary state.
• API and type coupling: Code that expects a specific subclass type (e.g., if (car instanceof Luxury) { ... }) becomes brittle. Changing trim would require many places to handle replacement or additional conditional logic.
• State migration complexity: Subclasses may add fields or behavior specific to a trim. Migrating these fields reliably when you replace an instance is error-prone and invasive.
• Persistence complications: If objects are persisted by class type (ORM polymorphic mapping), replacing the object can require schema/DB updates and careful migration.
• Manufacturing workflow semantics: A car’s production process usually attaches a stable identity (VIN) to a configuration that can change. Modeling configuration as class identity conflates identity with configuration.

Because the UML uses subclassing for trim, the current structure does not support safe, natural runtime trim changes.
