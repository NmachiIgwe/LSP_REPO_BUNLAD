Core idea: Model trim as a component (Strategy/Policy), not as the Carâ€™s class. Replace the subclassing of trim with a Trim interface and have Car hold a Trim field. This makes trim a first-class, changeable attribute of a Car object:

Design steps:

Define a Trim interface that encapsulates trim-specific behavior and data:

public interface Trim {
  String getName();           // "Base", "Luxury", "Sport"
  // Other trim-specific behaviors, e.g.:
  double getPriceAdjustment();
  List<String> getStandardFeatures();
}


concrete implementations: BaseTrim, LuxuryTrim, SportTrim implementing Trim.

Modify Car to use composition:

public class Car {
  private final String vin;     // stable identity
  private Trim trim;            // composition: changeable
  private Engine engine;        // still composition
  // other fields...

  public Car(String vin, Trim initialTrim, Engine engine) {
    this.vin = vin;
    this.trim = initialTrim;
    this.engine = engine;
  }

  public String getTrimLevel() {
    return trim.getName();
  }

  public void setTrim(Trim newTrim) {
    // validate constraints here (options compatibility, pricing hooks, etc.)
    this.trim = newTrim;
    // possible actions: recalc price, notify observers, persist change, run manufacturing checks
  }
}


Update factories and persistence: Persist trim as a primitive/property (trim_id or enum name) rather than on class mapping. Provide a CarFactory or builder that constructs Car with a chosen Trim.

Handle option migration and constraints: When switching trim, run a validation step to reconcile options (e.g., remove features not supported by the new trim, prompt customer choices, or add mandatory packages). Implement these as methods on Trim or within a TrimService.

Testing & rollout strategy: Add unit tests for setTrim behavior; if using DB, write migrations to store trim as a column and migrate existing subclass-mapped rows into the new representation.

Why composition is better here (advantages):

Dynamic behavior: Changing trim is a simple field assignment; the Car object identity and references remain intact.

Separation of concerns: Car handles identity and lifecycle; Trim encapsulates configuration details.

Reduced subclass explosion: You avoid creating many hybrid subclasses when combinations of trim + options multiply.

Easier maintenance and testing: Small Trim implementations are easier to unit test and evolve independently.

Persistence-friendly: Storing trim as a field (enum or reference) is simpler than class-based polymorphic mapping.

When to consider alternatives:

If trim change implies drastic stateful behavior changes (complex different state machines), consider the State pattern (where Trim also provides state transition logic) or combine composition with event-driven migration hooks. If you need to layer optional features, consider the Decorator pattern for feature packages.
